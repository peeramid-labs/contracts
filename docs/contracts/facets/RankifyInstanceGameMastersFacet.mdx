```solidity
event OverTime(uint256 gameId)
```

### LastTurn

```solidity
event LastTurn(uint256 gameId)
```

### ProposalScore

```solidity
event ProposalScore(uint256 gameId, uint256 turn, string proposalHash, string proposal, uint256 score)
```

### TurnEnded

```solidity
event TurnEnded(uint256 gameId, uint256 turn, address[] players, uint256[] scores, string[] newProposals, uint256[] proposerIndicies, uint256[][] votes)
```

### GameOver

```solidity
event GameOver(uint256 gameId, address[] players, uint256[] scores)
```

### ProposalSubmitted

```solidity
event ProposalSubmitted(uint256 gameId, uint256 turn, address proposer, bytes32 commitmentHash, string proposalEncryptedByGM)
```

### ProposalParams

```solidity
struct ProposalParams {
  uint256 gameId;
  string encryptedProposal;
  bytes32 commitmentHash;
  address proposer;
}
```

### VoteSubmitted

```solidity
event VoteSubmitted(uint256 gameId, uint256 turn, address player, string votesHidden)
```

### submitVote

```solidity
function submitVote(uint256 gameId, string encryptedVotes, address voter) public
```

_Submits a vote for a game. `gameId` is the ID of the game. `encryptedVotes` is the encrypted votes. `voter` is the address of the voter.

Emits a {VoteSubmitted} event.

Requirements:

- The caller must be a game master of the game with `gameId`.
- The game with `gameId` must exist.
- The game with `gameId` must have started.
- The game with `gameId` must not be over.
- `voter` must be in the game with `gameId`.
- The current turn of the game with `gameId` must be greater than 1._

### submitProposal

```solidity
function submitProposal(struct RankifyInstanceGameMastersFacet.ProposalParams proposalData) public
```

_Submits a proposal for a game. `proposalData` is the proposal data.

Requirements:

- The game with `proposalData.gameId` must exist.
- The caller must be a game master of the game with `proposalData.gameId`._

### endTurn

```solidity
function endTurn(uint256 gameId, uint256[][] votes, string[] newProposals, uint256[] proposerIndicies) public
```

_Ends the current turn of a game with the provided game ID. `gameId` is the ID of the game. `votes` is the array of votes. `newProposals` is the array of new proposals for the upcoming voting round. `proposerIndicies` is the array of indices of the proposers in the previous voting round.

Emits a {ProposalScore} event for each player if the turn is not the first.
Emits a {TurnEnded} event.

Modifies:

- Calls the `_nextTurn` function with `gameId` and `newProposals`.
- Resets the number of commitments of the game with `gameId` to 0.
- Resets the proposal commitment hash and ongoing proposal of each player in the game with `gameId`.

Requirements:

- The caller must be a game master of the game with `gameId`.
- The game with `gameId` must have started.
- The game with `gameId` must not be over.
-  newProposals array MUST be sorted randomly to ensure privacy
votes and proposerIndicies MUST correspond to players array from game.getPlayers()_
