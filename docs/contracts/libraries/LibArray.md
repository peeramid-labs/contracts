### internal function quickSort

```solidity
function quickSort(uint256[] arr, int256 left, int256 right) internal view 
```

*Sorts the elements of the array in ascending order using the quicksort algorithm.

Requirements:

- The array to be sorted must not be empty.
- The starting and ending indices must be within the bounds of the array.

Modifies:

- The array is sorted in ascending order.

Note:

- This function uses the in-place quicksort algorithm, which has an average-case complexity of O(n log n) and a worst-case complexity of O(n^2).*
