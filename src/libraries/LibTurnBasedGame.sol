/**
 * @title LibTBG
 * @dev Library for managing turn-based games.
 * It is designed to be used as a base library for games, and provides the following functionality:
 * - setting game settings such as time per turn, max players, min players, etc as well as perform score and leaderboard tracking
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - It is assumed there is only one game per player
 * - It is assumed there is only on game master per game
 *
 * ***WARNING*** Some limitations:
 * - This library is still under development and its interfaces may change.
 * - getting game data (which has own storage assigement and can be encapsulated from library) however there is no storage slot collision checks in place
 *
