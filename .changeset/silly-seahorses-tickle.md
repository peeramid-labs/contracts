## Addition of Ethereum Distribution System (EDS)

- **Feature**: Integrated the Ethereum Distribution System (EDS) for distributing Rankify contracts.
- **Description**: Rankify contracts are now distributed via the Ethereum Distribution System, enhancing the efficiency and security of the distribution process.

## Redesign of Contracts

- **Feature**: Redesigned contracts to work seamlessly as part of the Ethereum Distribution System.
- **Description**: The contracts have been restructured and optimized to ensure compatibility and smooth operation within the EDS framework. This redesign includes:
  - Improved contract architecture for better integration with EDS.
  - Enhanced security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities.
  - Optimized performance to handle the distribution process more efficiently.

## Impact

- **Users**:
  -  Can create new subjects that are called Meritocratic Autonomous Organizations (MAOs).
  -  Will benefit from a more secure and efficient distribution process.
- **Developers**: Developers will need to familiarize themselves with the new contract architecture and EDS integration.
- **Operations**: The distribution process will be streamlined, reducing the potential for errors and improving overall system reliability.

## Next Steps

- **Documentation**: Update the documentation to include details on the new EDS integration and contract redesign.
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the new system operates as expected.
- **Deployment**: Plan and execute the deployment of the updated contracts and distribution system.
